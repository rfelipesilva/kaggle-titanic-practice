# kaggle-titanic-practice
Practicing some data science...
Status: in-progress

### Plan
> - Use titanic kaggle dataset
> - use [PyCaret](https://pycaret.gitbook.io/docs/) (autoMl, model validation)
> - SHAP to explain model output? [SHAP](https://github.com/slundberg/shap)
> - Submission in the kaggle platform
> - Docker and/or binder to facilitate deployment

### Current score
> Score: 0.77033
> Leaderboard: 9090

    - 02_Process -> jupyter used to format and prepare file to submit

### To start playing with this analysis, there are two things you need to do:
